---============================================================================
--- SELF COMMAND HANDLER
---============================================================================

--- Handle custom console commands for Paladin.
--- Provides specialized command handling for PLD-specific operations and testing.
---
--- Available Commands:
---   test : Execute GearSwap module unit tests
---
--- @param cmdParams table Array of command parameters
--- @param eventArgs table Event arguments for command handling
--- @usage //gs c test (runs unit tests)
function job_self_command(cmdParams, eventArgs)
    -- First, try universal commands (equiptest, validate_all, etc.)
    local success_UniversalCommands, UniversalCommands = pcall(require, 'core/UNIVERSAL_COMMANDS')

    if handle_kaories_command and cmdParams[1] then
        local command = cmdParams[1]:lower()
        if handle_kaories_command(command) then
            eventArgs.handled = true

        eventArgs.handled = true
        return
    end

    -- Add other PLD-specific commands here as needed
end

--- Initialize gear sets for Paladin (duplicate function - legacy support).
--- This duplicate function exists for legacy compatibility but is not used.
--- The primary init_gear_sets() function above handles all initialization.
---
--- @deprecated This duplicate function is maintained for compatibility only
--- @see init_gear_sets Primary initialization function above
function init_gear_sets()
    -- All gear sets are defined in jobs/pld/PLD_SET.lua for better organization
end

---============================================================================
--- SPELL CASTING EVENT HANDLERS
---============================================================================

--- Handle pre-casting logic with specialized Paladin optimizations.
--- Performs comprehensive spell preparation including:
--- - Phalanx optimization with experience point mode integration
--- - Spell tracking for buff management and gear optimization
--- - Comprehensive spell handling and auto-ability coordination
--- - Cooldown checking and display for efficient spell usage
---
--- Special Handling:
---   - Phalanx: Automatically adjusts gear based on XP mode settings
---   - Spell tracking: Monitors spell usage for optimization algorithms
---
--- @param spell table The spell or ability being cast
--- @param action table The action object containing execution details
--- @param spellMap string Mote's spell classification mapping
--- @param eventArgs table Event arguments with cancel/handled flags

--- @see track_spell_precast For spell usage tracking
function job_precast(spell, action, spellMap, eventArgs)
    -- Universal metrics tracking for precast
    -- Metrics system removed during cleanup


    -- If the spell is Phalanx, call the handle_phalanx_while_xp function
    if spell.name == 'Phalanx' then
        handle_phalanx_while_xp(spell, eventArgs)
    end


    -- Special handling for Flash - check BEFORE any equipment changes
    if spell.name == 'Flash' and auto_abilities[spell.name] then
        auto_abilities[spell.name](spell, eventArgs)
        -- Si eventArgs.handled = true, on sort complÃ¨tement (pas d'Ã©quipement)
        if eventArgs.handled then
            return
        end
    end
    
    -- Handle the spell casting with auto_abilities (pour les autres spells)
    if spell.name ~= 'Flash' then
        handle_spell(spell, eventArgs, auto_abilities)
    end

    -- ADD: Track spell in precast
    track_spell_precast(spell)
    -- Check and display the recast cooldown - SKIP Flash completely
    if spell.name ~= 'Flash' then
        checkDisplayCooldown(spell, eventArgs)
    end
end

--- Handle mid-casting logic and optimizations.
--- Currently minimal implementation with placeholder for incapacitation checks.
--- Reserved for spell-specific gear swapping during casting phase.
---
--- Technical Note:
---   Incapacitation checking is commented out but available for future use
---   to handle spell interruption scenarios.
---
--- @param spell table The spell object being cast
--- @param action table The action object containing cast information
--- @param spellMap string Mote's spell classification mapping
--- @param eventArgs table Event arguments with cancel/handled flags

    -- Metrics system removed during cleanup


    -- Check if the player is incapacitated
    --[[ incapacitated(spell, eventArgs) ]]
end

--- Handle post-casting cleanup and advanced spell tracking.
--- Executes after spell completion to manage state transitions,
--- equipment updates, and spell usage analytics.
---
--- Features:
---   - Shared aftercast processing for common spell handling
---   - Advanced spell tracking for optimization algorithms
---   - State management and buff duration tracking
---
--- @param spell table The spell object that was executed

    handleSpellAftercast(spell, eventArgs)
    -- ADD: Track spell in aftercast
    track_spell_aftercast(spell)
end

---============================================================================
--- MACRO AND APPEARANCE MANAGEMENT
---============================================================================

--- Configure macro book and visual appearance for Paladin.
--- Automatically selects appropriate macro page based on subjob synergy
--- and applies the configured lockstyle set. Includes safe loading/unloading
--- of the dressup addon to prevent macro conflicts.
---
--- Macro Page Selection:
---   - BLU subjob: Page 1, Book 23 (Magic tanking focus)
---   - WAR subjob: Page 1, Book 21 (Physical tanking focus)
---   - RDM subjob: Page 1, Book 28 (Versatile casting support)
---   - RUN subjob: Page 1, Book 21 (Runic enhancement support)
---   - Default:    Page 1, Book 23 (General purpose tanking)
---   - Lockstyle set 3 applied with timing delay
---
--- Safety Features:
---   - Dressup addon safely unloaded/reloaded to prevent macro loss
---   - Timing delays prevent addon conflicts
---
--- @usage Called automatically during user_setup
--- @see user_setup For initialization context
function select_default_macro_book()
    -- Load macro manager safely
    -- MacroManager now available globally via shared.lua
    -- Check if module is loaded, fallback to direct require if needed
    local macro_manager = MacroManager
    if not macro_manager then
        local success, result = pcall(require, 'macros/macro_manager')
        if success and result then
            macro_manager = result
        end
    end
    
    -- Unload dressup first
    send_command('lua unload dressup')
    
    -- Use centralized system with message display
    if macro_manager and macro_manager.setup_job_macro_lockstyle then
        macro_manager.setup_job_macro_lockstyle('PLD', player.sub_job, true) -- true = show message
    elseif setup_job_macro_lockstyle then
        -- Fallback to global function
        setup_job_macro_lockstyle('PLD', player.sub_job, true)
    else
        windower.add_to_chat(158, '[PLD] Macro management not available, using basic setup')
        -- Basic fallback
        send_command('input /macro book 1; input /macro set 1')
    end
    
    -- Reload dressup after delay
    send_command('wait 20; lua load dressup')
end
